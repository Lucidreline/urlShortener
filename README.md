A simple web app that takes in a URL and returns a shorter URL (assuming the original URL was very long) that takes you to the same website.


For example, Amazon products usually have a long URL. Here are both the URL given from my web app and the original URL. You can click on both and see that you are taken to the same Amazon product.
